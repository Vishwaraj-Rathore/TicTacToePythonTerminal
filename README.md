# TicTacToe
Just a basic terminal based Python tic tac toe program I am working on.
Will be making a basic functionality where a player can choose to be X or O and then play against the computer.
After that is successful might try to make it so that the computer also uses the few tricks there are to win and also blocks if these tricks are used by the player.
